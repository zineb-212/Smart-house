## Main Features of the Miniature Smart House

- **Smart Entry System:** The doors (including the garage) open via RFID tag or security code for controlled access.

- **Environmental Display:** A display shows the current time, date, humidity, and indoor temperature.

- **Automatic Fan Activation:** When the indoor temperature rises above a set threshold, the fan automatically activates to cool the house.

- **Bathroom Automation:**

    - When someone enters the bathroom, the lights and fan automatically turn on.
    - A light matrix displays a "sad" face üôÅ when the bathroom is occupied , and switches to a "happy" face üôÇ when it's vacant, with the lights and fan deactivating.
- **Remote-Controlled Room Lights:** The room lights can be controlled via a mobile phone and can change colors based on user preference.

- **Gas and Smoke Detection:** A buzzer activates along with the fan if smoke or gas is detected in the air, ensuring safety.

- **Garden Pool Lighting:** The lights around the pool in the garden automatically activate during the night for enhanced ambiance and safety.

## Learning Outcomes :
- **Practical Integration of Sensors and Actuators:** We learned how to effectively integrate various sensors (temperature, humidity, gas, ...) and actuators ( motors, fans, lights, ...) using Arduino.

- **Automation and Control Systems:** We gained a deeper understanding of designing automation systems, including temperature-based fan control, automatic lighting, and smart entry systems..


- **Mobile Phone Integration:** We explored the remote control of home systems via mobile devices, improving our understanding of wireless communication and smart home interfaces.

- **Troubleshooting and Problem Solving:** Throughout the project, we sharpened our ability to identify and resolve both hardware and software issues, critical for ensuring smooth system operation.

- **Collaboration and Teamwork:** Working together on designing, building, and integrating components allowed us to enhance our collaboration and project management skills, essential for tackling complex projects in the future.

- **Advanced Programming Skills:** Writing efficient code for multiple systems to communicate with each other, we improved our proficiency in embedded programming and optimized performance for smooth operations.
