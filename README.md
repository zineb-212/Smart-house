## Overview
My team and I embarked on an innovative project to develop a miniature smart house using Arduino controllers, which integrates various smart technologies to enhance automation, safety, and convenience. We began by designing the model, followed by constructing it and carefully integrating the components to create a functional prototype. This project provided us with valuable hands-on experience in electronics, programming, and teamwork, while deepening our understanding of automation, it equipped us with the confidence and skills needed to tackle more complex technological challenges in the future.
